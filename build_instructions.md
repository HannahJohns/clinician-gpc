# Instructions for Building on a local machine

This software relies on several tools not provided as part of
this repository.

The downloadable version of this tool uses the (DesktopDeployR framework)[https://github.com/wleepang/DesktopDeployR]. In order for it to work,
you will additionally need to install (R portable)[https://sourceforge.net/projects/rportable/] into the source/dist/R-portable directory.

(Inno Setup)[https://jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php] is used to create the installation file for download. If you want to compile the app into an installable executable, you will also need to download this tool.
